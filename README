DESCRIPTION
    Apache::AuthCookie allows you to intercept a user's first
    unauthenticated access to a protected document. The user will be
    presented with a custom form where they can enter authentication
    credentials. The credentials are posted to the server where AuthCookie
    verifies them and returns a session key.

    The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a
    cookie, the browser will pass the session key on every subsequent
    accesses. AuthCookie will verify the session key and re-authenticate the
    user.

    All you have to do is write a custom module that inherits from
    AuthCookie. Your module is a class which implements two methods:

    `authen_cred()'
        Verify the user-supplied credentials and return a session key. The
        session key can be any string - often you'll use some string
        containing username, timeout info, and any other information you
        need to determine access to documents, and append a one-way hash of
        those values together with some secret key.

    `authen_ses_key()'
        Verify the session key (previously generated by `authen_cred()',
        possibly during a previous request) and return the user ID. This
        user ID will be fed to `$r->connection->user()' to set Apache's idea
        of who's logged in.

    By using AuthCookie versus Apache's built-in AuthBasic you can design
    your own authentication system. There are several benefits.

    1.  The client doesn't *have* to pass the user credentials on every
        subsequent access. If you're using passwords, this means that the
        password can be sent on the first request only, and subsequent
        requests don't need to send this (potentially sensitive)
        information. This is known as "ticket-based" authentication.

    2.  When you determine that the client should stop using the
        credentials/session key, the server can tell the client to delete
        the cookie. Letting users "log out" is a notoriously impossible-to-
        solve problem of AuthBasic.

    3.  AuthBasic dialog boxes are ugly. You can design your own HTML login
        forms when you use AuthCookie.

    4.  You can specify the domain of a cookie using PerlSetVar commands. For
        instance, if your AuthName is `WhatEver', you can put the command

         PerlSetVar WhatEverDomain .yourhost.com

        into your server setup file and your access cookies will span all
        hosts ending in `.yourhost.com'.

    This is the flow of the authentication handler, less the details of the
    redirects. Two REDIRECT's are used to keep the client from displaying
    the user's credentials in the Location field. They don't really change
    AuthCookie's model, but they do add another round-trip request to the
    client.

             (---------------------)

     *  The session key that the client gets can be anything you want.  For
        example, encrypted information about the user, a hash of the
        username and password (similar in function to Digest
        authentication), or the user name and password in plain text
        (similar in function to HTTP Basic authentication).

        The only requirement is that the authen_ses_key function that you
        create must be able to determine if this session_key is valid and
        map it back to the originally authenticated user ID.

METHODS
    `Apache::AuthCookie' has several methods you should know about. Here is
    the documentation for each. =)

    * authenticate()
        This method is one you'll use in a server config file (httpd.conf,
        .htaccess, ...) as a PerlAuthenHandler. If the user provided a
        session key in a cookie, the `authen_ses_key()' method will get
        called to check whether the key is valid. If not, or if there is no
        key provided, we redirect to the login form.

    * authorize()
        This will step through the `require' directives you've given for
        protected documents and make sure the user passes muster. The
        `require valid-user' and `require user joey-jojo' directives are
        handled for you. You can implement custom directives, such as
        `require species hamster', by defining a method called `hamster()'
        in your subclass, which will then be called. The method will be
        called as `$r->hamster($r, $args)', where `$args' is everything on
        your `require' line after the word `hamster'. The method should
        return OK on success and FORBIDDEN on failure.

        Currently users must satisfy ALL of the `require' directives. I have
        heard that other Apache modules let the user satisfy ANY of the
        `require' directives. I don't know which is correct, I haven't found
        any Apache docs on the matter. If you need one behavior or the
        other, be careful. I may change it if I discover that ANY is
        correct.

    * authen_cred()
        You must define this method yourself in your subclass of
        `Apache::AuthCookie'. Its job is to create the session key that will
        be preserved in the user's cookie. The arguments passed to it are:

         sub authen_cred ($$\@) {
           my $self = shift;  # Package name (same as AuthName directive)
           my $r    = shift;  # Apache request object
           my @cred = @_;     # Credentials from login form

           ...blah blah blah, create a session key...
           return $session_key;
         }

        The only limitation on the session key is that you should be able to
        look at it later and determine the user's username. You are
        responsible for implementing your own session key format. A typical
        format is to make a string that contains the username, an expiration
        time, whatever else you need, and an MD5 hash of all that data
        together with a secret key. The hash will ensure that the user
        doesn't tamper with the session key. More info in the Eagle book.

    * authen_ses_key()
        You must define this method yourself in your subclass of
        Apache::AuthCookie. Its job is to look at a session key and
        determine whether it is valid. If so, it returns the username of the
        authenticated user.

         sub authen_ses_key ($$$) {
           my ($self, $r, $session_key) = @_;
           ...blah blah blah, check whether $session_key is valid...
           return $ok ? $username : undef;
         }

    * login()
        This method handles the submission of the login form. It will call
        the `authen_cred()' method, passing it `$r' and all the submitted
        data with names like `"credential_#"', where # is a number. These
        will be passed in a simple array, so the prototype is `$self-
        >authen_cred($r, @credentials)'. After calling `authen_cred()', we
        set the user's cookie and redirect to the URL contained in the
        `"destination"' submitted form field.

    * logout()
        This is simply a convenience method that unsets the session key for
        you. You can call it in your logout scripts. Usually this looks like
        `$r->auth_type->logout($r);'.

    * recognize_user()
        If the user has provided a valid session key but the document isn't
        protected, this method will set `$r->connection->user' anyway. Use
        it as a PerlFixupHandler, unless you have a better idea.

    * key()
        This method will return the current session key, if any. This can be
        handy inside a method that implements a `require' directive check
        (like the `species' method discussed above) if you put any extra
        information like clearances or whatever into the session key.

UPGRADING FROM VERSION 1.4
    There are a few interface changes that you need to be aware of when
    migrating from version 1.x to 2.x. First, the authen() and authz()
    methods are now deprecated, replaced by the new authenticate() and
    authorize() methods. The old methods will go away in a couple versions,
    but are maintained intact in this version to ease the task of upgrading.
    The use of these methods is essentially the same, though.

    Second, when you change to the new method names (see previous
    paragraph), you must change the action of your login forms to the
    location /LOGIN (or whatever URL will call your module's login()
    method). You may also want to change their METHOD to POST instead of
    GET, since that's much safer and nicer to look at (but you can leave it
    as GET if you bloody well want to, for some god-unknown reason).

    Third, you must change your login forms (see the section on "THE LOGIN
    SCRIPT" below) to indicate how requests should be redirected after a
    successful login.

    Fourth, you might want to take advantage of the new `logout()' method,
    though you certainly don't have to.

EXAMPLE
    For an example of how to use Apache::AuthCookie, you may want to check
    out the test suite, which runs AuthCookie through a few of its paces.
    The documents are located in t/eg/, and you may want to peruse t/real.t
    to see the generated httpd.conf file (at the bottom of real.t) and check
    out what requests it's making of the server (at the top of real.t).

THE LOGIN SCRIPT
    You will need to create a login script (called login.pl above) that
    generates an HTML form for the user to fill out. The following fields
    must be present in the form:

    1.  The ACTION of the form must be /LOGIN (or whatever you defined in your
        server configuration, as in the SYNOPSIS section).

    2.  The various user input fields (username, passwords, etc.) must be named
        'credential_0', 'credential_1', etc. on the form.

    3.  You must define a form field called 'destination' that tells AuthCookie
        where to redirect the request after successfully logging in.
        Typically this value is obtained from `$r->prev->uri'. See the
        login.pl script in t/eg/.

THE LOGOUT SCRIPT
    If you want to let users log themselves out (something that can't be
    done using Basic Auth), you need to create a logout script. For an
    example, see t/eg/logout.pl. Logout scripts may want to take advantage
    of AuthCookie's `logout()' method, which will set the proper cookie
    headers in order to clear the user's cookie. This usually looks like
    `$r->auth_type->logout($r);'.

    Note that if you don't necessarily trust your users, you can't count on
    cookie deletion for logging out. You'll have to expire some server-side
    login information too. AuthCookie doesn't do this for you, you have to
    handle it yourself.

ABOUT SESSION KEYS
    Unlike the sample AuthCookieHandler, you have you verify the user's
    login and password in `authen_cred()', then you do something like:

        my $date = localtime;
        my $ses_key = MD5->hexhash(join(';', $date, $PID, $PAC));

    save `$ses_key' along with the user's login, and return `$ses_key'.

    Now `authen_ses_key()' looks up the `$ses_key' passed to it and returns
    the saved login. I use Oracle to store the session key and retrieve it
    later, see the ToDo section below for some other ideas.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
    If the first unauthenticated request is a POST, it will be changed to a
    GET after the user fills out the login forms, and POSTed data will be
    lost.

  TO DO

    *   There ought to be a way to solve the POST problem in the LIMITATIONS
        section. It involves being able to re-insert the POSTed content into
        the request stream after the user authenticates.

        It might be nice if the logout method could accept some parameters
        that could make it easy to redirect the user to another URI, or
        whatever. I'd have to think about the options needed before I
        implement anything, though.
