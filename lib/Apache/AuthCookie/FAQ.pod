=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document serves to answer the most frequently asked questions about L<Apache::AuthCookie>.

=head2 How can I protect an entire site (/) with Apache::AuthCookie?

You have to give an Apache C<require> directive that applies to all requests
for B<except> for your login handler.  The easiest way to do this is to
override the auth handlers for your login script. For example, if your login
handler is C</LOGIN>, then you need to use something like the following:

 <Location />
   AuthType My::AuthCookieHandler
   AuthName Whatever
   PerlAuthenHandler Sample::AuthCookieHandler->authenticate
   PerlAuthzHandler Sample::AuthCookieHandler->authorize
   require valid-user
 </Location>

 <Location /LOGIN>
   PerlAuthenHandler Apache2::Const::OK
   PerlAuthzHandler Apache2::Const::OK
 </Location>
 ...
