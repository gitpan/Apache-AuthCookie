Apache::AuthCookie - Perl Authentication and Authorization via cookies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<use mod_perl qw(1.07 StackedHandlers MethodHandlers Authen Authz);>

 # mod_perl startup script

 use Sample::AuthCookieHandler;

 # access.conf or .htaccess

 </Location>

=for html
</PRE>
=end html

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Apache::AuthCookie> allows you to intercept a users first
unauthenticated access to a protected document. The user will be
presented with a custom form where they can enter thier authentication
credentials. The credentials are posted to the server where AuthCookie
verifies them and generates a session key.

The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a
cookie, the browser will pass the session key on every subsequent
accesses. AuthCookie will verify the session key and re-authenticate
the user.

All you have to do is write a custom package that inheriets from
AuthCookie.  Your package implements two functions:

=over 4

=item C<authen_cred()>

Verify the credentials and return a session key.

=item C<authen_ses_key()>

Verify the session key and return the user ID.

=back

Using AuthCookie versus AuthBasic you get two key benefits.

=over 4

=item 1.

The client doesn't *have* to pass the user credentials on every
subsequent access. You have to do a little more work to get this
feature, by having C<authen_cred()> generate a session key.

=item 2.

When you determine that the client should stop using the
credentials/session key, the server can tell the client to delete the
cookie.

=back

This is the flow of the authentication handler, less the details of the
redirects. Two REDIRECT's are used to keep the client from displaying
the user's credentials in the Location field. They don't really change
AuthCookie's model, but they do add another round-trip request to the
client.

 *  The session key that the client gets can be anything you
    want. For example, encrypted information about the user, a
    hash of the username and password (similar in function to
    Digest authentication), or the user name and password in
    plain text (similar in function to HTTP Basic
    authentication).

    They only catch is that the authen_ses_key function that you
    create must be able to determine if this session_key is valid
    and map it back to the originally authenticated user ID.

=for html
</PRE>

=head1 EXAMPLE

Try the sample in eg/.

=head2 Install the sample

=over 4

=item 1.

Install eg/Sample into the site_perl directory in your perl5 library
directory.

=item 2.

Install eg/unprotected into your Apache document root directory.

=item 3.

Add C<use Sample::AuthCookieHandler;> to your mod_perl startup script
or C<Sample::AuthCookieHandler> to your PerlModule configuration
directive.

=item 4.

Restart Apache so mod_perl picks up C<Sample::AuthCookieHandler>.

=back

=head2 Tryout the sample

=over 4

=item 1.

Try to access /unprotected/protected/get_me.html. You should instead get
a form requesting a login and password. The sample will validate two
users. The first is login => programmer and password => Hero and the
second is login => some-user with no/any password. You might want to
set your browser to show you cookies before accepting them. Then you
can see what AuthCookie is generating.

=item 2.

As distributed, the .htaccess file in F<eg/unprotected/protected> will allow
either of these user to access the document. However if you change the
line C<require valid-user> to C<require dwarf> in .htaccess only the
user "programmer" will have access. Look at the authorization function
C<dwarf()> in F<eg/Sample/AuthCookieHandler.pm> to see how this works.

=head2 Using a Session Key

Unlike the sample AuthCookieHandler, you have you verify the user's
login and password in C<authen_cred()>, then you do something
like:

    my $date = localtime;
    my $ses_key = MD5->hexhash(join(';', $date, $PID, $PAC));

save C<$ses_key> alogin with the user's login, and return C<$ses_key>.

Now C<authen_ses_key()> looks up the C<$ses_key> passed to it and
returns the saved login.  I use Oracle to store the session key and
retrieve it later, see the ToDo section below for some other ideas.

=head1 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

The first unauthenticated request can not be a POST. B<Apache::AuthCookie>
interupts the initial request with the form for the user credentials.

=head2 ToDo

=over 4

=item *

See if there's a way to allow the initial request to be a POST.  I know
B<Apache::AuthCookie> could save the original POST'ed material but I
don't know how to re-insert this content into the request stream after
the user authenticates.  If you knows of a way, please drop me a note.

=item *

Create a session key store that uses shared memory.  If anyone wants to
get together and help with this that would be cool.  Storing and
retrieving them should be easy, but the harder part is cleaning out
"old" keys and dealing with server restarts without losing all the
keys.
