Revision history for Perl extension Apache::AuthCookie.

2.0
  - Now owned by Ken Williams (ken@forum.swarthmore.edu)

  - Created indentify() and authorize() methods to replace authen()
    and authz().  authen() and authz() are now deprecated and will 
    disappear in a later version.

  - AuthType can now contain colons [adi@certsite.com (Adi)]

  - Nonexistent method calls (via 'require' directive) are no longer
    shielded in authorization stage - if it fails it fails, and you 
    get a server error.

  - Multiple 'require' directives should work now - previously only
    the first directive was respected.


1.3_03
	- Make synopsis access control params match the example. Pointed
	  out by tad@webcollective.com.
	- Added <Files> to the .htaccess in the sample to enable ExecCGI.
	- Nate Wilken reported that AuthCookie works as-is on Win32 with
	  a post 1.10 version of mod_perl and post 1.3b5 version of Apache.
	  (These versions add support for mod_perl's error_document method
	  on Win32. For earlier versions, AuthCookie can be modified to use
	  the ErrorDocument directive in the Apache config.)
	- Cleanup "Use of uninitialized value" warnings sotted by 
	  Marlys Nelson <marlys.a.nelson@UWRF.EDU>.

1.3_02
	- login.pl now uses $r->prev to get authtype and authname, so it
	  doesn't have to be in the same hierarchy as the proctected docs.
	  Thanks to Liam Kirsher <liam@numenet.com> for spotting this.
	- Steve Shreeve <shreeve@meded.med.uci.edu> tracked down a segv
	  from $r->err_header_out("Location"... I never could reproduce
	  this, but he said this $r->header_out("Location"... worked.
	- Fixed typo pointed out by Nate Wilken <wilken@mr_x.inre.asu.edu>
	- Changed directory eg/sample to eg/unprotected for compatibility
	  with windows pointed out by Nate Wilken <wilken@mr_x.inre.asu.edu>
1.3_01
	- Fix error where the cookie wasn't printed when debugging was
	  turned on.
	- Consistantly treat the session key as a string. This meant a
	  change to the authen_* function prototypes, you may need to
	  change ones you've already written.

1.3
	- First public release on CPAN, removed from Apache contrib.
