Version: 2.004  Date: 2000/03/15 20:53:20
   Added documentation about the ability to set cookie domains.  That
   ability actually appeared in 2.002, but I forgot to document it or add
   notes to the Changes file.


Version: 2.003  Date: 2000/03/14 21:08:02
   Now returns FORBIDDEN instead of AUTH_REQUIRED when authorization
   fails or when a user tries to access a protected doc.


Version: 2.002  Date: 2000/03/14 17:46:42
   Added an internal _cookie_string method that helps construct cookie
   strings.  This shouldn't change any functionality, but makes my job
   easier.
   
   Added a couple of Makefile.PL questions that set the user & group
   tests should run under.


Version: 2.001  Date: 2000/02/11 04:46:59
   The login forms may now use the POST method instead of the GET method.
   This is a big deal, because with GET the user's credentials get logged
   to access logs, they remain in the user's browser history, and so on.
   Thanks to cholet@logilune.com (Eric Cholet) for the patch and prodding.
   
   There is now a proper test suite, which will fire up an httpd and make
   requests of it.  The test code is adapted from Eric's old example
   (eg/) suite.
   
   I've added a logout() method to help unset cookies.  The example
   logout.pl now uses logout().  Thanks to Aaron Ross
   (ross@mathforum.com).


Version: 2.000  Date: 2000/02/02 13:18:23
   First released version, bumped up revision number to 2.0
   
   Created indentify() and authorize() methods to replace authen() and
   authz().  authen() and authz() are now deprecated and will disappear
   in a later version.
   
   AuthType can now contain colons [adi@certsite.com (Adi)]
   
   Nonexistent method calls (via 'require' directive) are no longer
   shielded in authorization stage - if it fails it fails, and you get a
   server error.
   
   Multiple 'require' directives should work now - previously only the
   first directive was respected.
   
   Changed lots of documentation to reflect the above interface changes.
