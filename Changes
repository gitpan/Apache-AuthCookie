Revision history for Perl extension Apache::AuthCookie.

1.3_02
	- login.pl now uses $r->prev to get authtype and authname, so it
	  doesn't have to be in the same hierarchy as the proctected docs.
	  Thanks to Liam Kirsher <liam@numenet.com> for spotting this.
	- Steve Shreeve <shreeve@meded.med.uci.edu> tracked down a segv
	  from $r->err_header_out("Location"... I never could reproduce
	  this, but he said this $r->header_out("Location"... worked.
	- Fixed typo pointed out by Nate Wilken <wilken@mr_x.inre.asu.edu>
	- Changed directory eg/sample to eg/unprotected for compatibility
	  with windows pointed out by Nate Wilken <wilken@mr_x.inre.asu.edu>
	- Make synopsis access control params match the example. Pointed
	  out by tad@webcollective.com.

1.3_01
	- Fix error where the cookie wasn't printed when debugging was
	  turned on.
	- Consistantly treat the session key as a string. This meant a
	  change to the authen_* function prototypes, you may need to
	  change ones you've already written.

1.3
	- First public release on CPAN, removed from Apache contrib.
