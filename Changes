Version: 2.007  Date: 2000/04/15 15:27:02
   If the browser sends a cookie but it's not one related to our
   authentication, we formerly sent a blank cookie to the authentication
   methods.  Now we act as if no cookie was sent.

   Fixed a server error that occurred when a certain user was required,
   but a different valid user was logged in.
   [efujii@miis.edu (Eduardo Fujii)]
   
   Added a couple more debug statements that can help figure out what's
   happening when your auth isn't working.
   
   Improved some of the docs.
   
   Added some tricks to Makefile.PL to make my life easier.
   
   Changed the action of the example login forms from LOGIN to /LOGIN.

Version: 2.006  Date: 2000/03/26 18:28:32
   Added the key() method, which will return the user's current session
   key, if any.  This can be handy inside a method that implements a
   C<require> directive check (like the C<species> method discussed
   above) if you put any extra information like clearances or whatever
   into the session key.
   
   Added method-by-method documentation for each method in AuthCookie.


Version: 2.005  Date: 2000/03/24 15:20:30
   Removed the deprecated methods ->authen and ->authz.  If you have
   configurations that use these methods, you must change to the newer
   ->authenticate and ->authorize methods.
   
   Changed a couple of 'Sample's in the documentation to
   'Sample::AuthCookieHandler'.  [asparks@cpd.harris.com (Alan Sparks)]


Version: 2.004  Date: 2000/03/15 20:53:20
   Added documentation about the ability to set cookie domains.  That
   ability actually appeared in 2.002, but I forgot to document it or add
   notes to the Changes file.


Version: 2.003  Date: 2000/03/14 21:08:02
   Now returns FORBIDDEN instead of AUTH_REQUIRED when authorization
   fails or when a user tries to access a protected doc.


Version: 2.002  Date: 2000/03/14 17:46:42
   Added an internal _cookie_string method that helps construct cookie
   strings.  This shouldn't change any functionality, but makes my job
   easier.
   
   Added a couple of Makefile.PL questions that set the user & group
   tests should run under.


Version: 2.001  Date: 2000/02/11 04:46:59
   The login forms may now use the POST method instead of the GET method.
   This is a big deal, because with GET the user's credentials get logged
   to access logs, they remain in the user's browser history, and so on.
   Thanks to cholet@logilune.com (Eric Cholet) for the patch and prodding.
   
   There is now a proper test suite, which will fire up an httpd and make
   requests of it.  The test code is adapted from Eric's old example
   (eg/) suite.
   
   I've added a logout() method to help unset cookies.  The example
   logout.pl now uses logout().  Thanks to Aaron Ross
   (ross@mathforum.com).


Version: 2.000  Date: 2000/02/02 13:18:23
   First released version, bumped up revision number to 2.0
   
   Created indentify() and authorize() methods to replace authen() and
   authz().  authen() and authz() are now deprecated and will disappear
   in a later version.
   
   AuthType can now contain colons [adi@certsite.com (Adi)]
   
   Nonexistent method calls (via 'require' directive) are no longer
   shielded in authorization stage - if it fails it fails, and you get a
   server error.
   
   Multiple 'require' directives should work now - previously only the
   first directive was respected.
   
   Changed lots of documentation to reflect the above interface changes.
